# QA Test Project: Hundt Application (Web & Mobile)

This repository contains a comprehensive Quality Assurance project for the **Hundt** application, covering both its web and mobile platforms. It demonstrates a full-cycle testing approach, from initial planning and analysis to final reporting.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The purpose of this project is to showcase a structured and professional approach to software testing. It includes analyzing requirements, creating a strategic test plan, designing and documenting ~100 test cases, and ensuring full requirements traceability (RTM).

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodologies

This project was created using a professional QA stack to simulate a real-world environment:

* **Documentation & Planning:** Confluence (exported to PDF)
* **Test Case Management:** MS Excel / Google Sheets
* **Test Design Techniques:** Application Decomposition (Mind Mapping), Requirements Analysis, Permission Testing.
* **Tracking (Simulated):** Jira / Trello

## 📂 Project Artifacts

All test artifacts are organized into folders corresponding to the phases of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).

### 1. Planning and Analysis
* **[Test Plan - Hundt.pdf](https://github.com/konradtech2/Software_Tester_Portfolio_Project/blob/main/1_Planning_and_Analysis/Test%20Plan%20-%20Hundt.pdf.pdf)**: Defines the overall strategy, scope, resources, environment, and criteria for the testing process.
* **[Permission Table Testing - Hundt.pdf](https://github.com/konradtech2/Software_Tester_Portfolio_Project/blob/main/1_Planning_and_Analysis/Permission%20Table%20Testing%20-%20Hundt.pdf)**: An analysis of user roles and their specific access rights across the application, forming the basis for security and role-based testing.
